-- | Send down a pulse, and measure how long the pin reports a corresponding pulse, with a potential time-out. The call @pulse p v duration mbTimeOut@
-- does the following:
--
--   * Set the pin to value @v@ for @duration@ microseconds.
--
--   * Waits 2 microseconds
--
--   * Waits until pin @p@ has value @not v@.
--
--   * Returns, in micro-seconds, the duration the pin stayed @v@, counting from the 2 microsecond wait.
--
-- Time-out parameter is used as follows:
--
--    * If @mbTimeOut@ is @Nothing@, then 'pulse' will wait until the pin attains the value required and so long as it holds it.
--    Note that very-long time-out values are unlikely to be accurate.
-- 
--    * If @mbTimeOut@ is @Just t@ then, 'pulse' will stop if the above procedure does not complete within the given micro-seconds.
--    In this case, the overall return value is @Nothing@.
--
-- NB. Both the time-out value and the return value are given in micro-seconds.
--
-- NB. As of March 2 2013; StandardFirmata that's distributed with the Arduino-App does /not/ support the Pulse-In command.
-- However, there is a patch to add this command; see: <http://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five/issues/18> for details.
-- If you want to use hArduino's @pulseIn@ command, then you /have/ to install the above patch. Also see the function
-- @pulseIn_hostOnly@, which works with the distributed StandardFirmata: It implements a version that is not as
-- accurate in its timing, but might be sufficient if high precision is not required.
